1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
ans - more hidden nodes allow the the network to learn more complex patterns, this means the network will
      take longer to train and require more memory. Overfitting can occur due to smaller dataset.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
ans - initially with 1-2 hidden units the accuracy is low.
      from 2-3 hidden units the accuracy jumps indicating that 3 hidden units are enough.
      from 3-5 hidden units the accuracy is slightly improving.
      from 20-50 hidden units the accuracy drops, this could mean its overfitting.
